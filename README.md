# BYTE-FORCE
Description 
For the design of our vehicle, several steps were carried out, both on the software side 
(the codes) and on the hardware side (the parts or components). First we worked on the 
hardware part since on this side the assembly for the skeleton of our cart was made, 
then we moved on to the part in which the L298n Modulator was assembled, and this is 
when we also started with the software part, because we needed a code which would 
help us turn on the engine which would work with our modulator. Once this was done, 
we moved on to the assembly of our servomotor, which of course also required a code 
so that it could move and thus direct where the car should go. After this we went to the 
phase for the connection of our HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, for this sensor it required 
many tests in our code, so that it could detect objects and in that way our cart would 
not crash. After this we moved on to our final phase which was the assembly of our 
color sensor, which, likewise, required a configuration that is, it needed a code so that 
it could work. The realization of each of the components was successful thanks to an 
Arduino board, which was very helpful along with the different cables and batteries. 
And we conclude by expressing that, for the realization of our cart, both the software 
part (the codes) and the hardware part (the parts) were given together, since both 
worked effectively for each of the movements of our vehicle.
